## DW Database Queries
This project involved querying a data warehouse to answer specific questions about the data. The relevant files and folder include  

* The _Data Warehouse Queries.pdf_ file provides instructions for this lab project.
* The _DataWarehouse_ folder contains the data warehouse files.  
* The _DW Database Solutions.sql_ file contains the SQL script with questions embedded before the code that answers the question.  
* The _DW Database Schema.pdf_ illustrates the structure of the data warehouse.  

## ETL Project
The goal of this project was to design and implement a data warehouse for the ficticious BIke Project Company (hereafter BIke). BIke executives have declared that a new data warehouse is to be the center piece of their Data Driven Decision Making strategic initiative and must be capable of answering typical business intelligence (BI) questions.

The project was broken into two parts. In part 1, I used Microsoft’s SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to construct a repeatable ETL process to move data from several data sources into a dimensional model instantiated as a SQL Server relational database. In part 2, I accessed the completed data warehouse tables via an OLAP layer implemented using Microsoft’s SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

## Flatten 3NF Tables  
This project involved converting dimension-related data from third normal form to first normal form.  The relevant files include  

* The _Flatten Dimensions Lab.pdf_ file provides instructions for this lab project.  
* The _AdventureWorks2012 3NF Customer Related Tables.pdf_ file illustrates the structure of the third normal form database. It provides the table and attribute names that are used in the SQL script to perform the conversion.  
* The _Flatten3NF_CREATE-n-INSERT.sql_ file contains the conversion script.

## T-SQL Scripting
This project is a tutorial for scripting in Transact-SQL. The relevant files and folder include  

* The three PDF files _T-SQL Basics_Part1_, _T-SQL Basics_Part2_, and _T-SQL Basics_Part3_ are the tutorial instruction files.  
* The _Northwind_ folder contains the data warehouse files.  
* The _T-SQL Tutorial Queries.sql_ and _TRY-CATCH.sql_ files are the completed tutorial scripts.
